        " *  There is an \"exception\" to this as well. 0 is divisible by *almost* any number other than itself. Then natural number which 0 is not divisible by is itself (just as **no** number is divisible by 0). Some definitions for composite numbers state that a coomposite number must be divisible by 1, itself, and another natural number. Other definitions just state that the number must be divisible by a natural number other than 1 and itself. Regardless, it is widely accepted that 0 is **not** composite.\n",

        "Now, lets test some numbers to check if they are prime, composite, or neither. To do this, we will use the Python % operator. This divides a number into integers and returns the remainder. For instance $6/4=1$ with a remainder of 2 since $4*1+2=6$. Thus, we can write $6\\%4=2$. The simplest way to use this for checking if a number is prime or composite is to check the remainder of each possible division of that number (other than by 1 and itself). If any remainder is 0, then our number is evenly divisible into a natural number other than 1 and itself, and it is composite. Otherwise, it is prime (unless, of course, our number is 0 or 1)."

However, this process was quite tedious as we have to manually write out the calculations. What if we want to find out if 27 is prime or composite? We would potentially need to check 25 values to determine whether 27 is prime or not. So, here I will introduce a simple algorithm that returns the factors of any integer fed to it.

However, we did not have a case where 16 was divided by a number and resulted in 5. So, we *already knew* that 16 wasn't divisible by 5. All of the factors of 16 can be found by looking at our calculations when dividing by 1, 2, 3, and 4. $16/1=16$, so 1 and 16 are factors of 16. $16/2=8$, so 2 and 8 are factors of 16. $16/4=4$, so 4 is a factors of 16. This means that the factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. We can verify this with the code below."

        "# RSA Encryption\n",
        "At some point, one must ask the question, \"what's so special about prime numbers\"? This is a valid question. Mathematically, there are many aspects of prime numbers that make them \"special\". Still, is there any *practical* use for them? Well, actually, yes! In computer science, prime numbers are very important. Encryption algorithms, like RSA (which we will discuss soon), rely on prime numbers to keep information private. Without encryption, your passwords, messages, bank account info, and anything else you have that is accessed over the internet could easily be seen by anyone. Seeing how valuable this is, let's look at the RSA algorithm to see how prime numbers can keep your information safe.\n",
        "\n",
        "The information regarding RSA encryption discussed here is based off of the explanation found at https://brilliant.org/wiki/rsa-encryption/. Suppose you wish to send a message to your friend, but there is a possibility that someone who shouldn't read it could (perhaps you are sending the message by paper airplane and they snatch it out of the air?). If you send this message as is, then anyone who gets their hands on it will be able to read it. You need a secret code. How do you set it up though? First, your friend needs to create a code that is made up of 2 parts. There is the public code that anyone can see, and there is the private code that only your friend can see. Your friend sends you this public code (and also keeps a copy of it for themself). When you get this code, you can use it to encode your message and send it back to your friend. With your message encoded, it doesn't matter it someone else sees it. In fact, it doesn't even matter if they see the public code. When your friend gets the message, they can use their private code to decode it. In this way, they are the only person who knows what you wrote.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is essentially what occurs when RSA encryption is used. However, the \"codes\" are actually referred to as keys. So, how do we create them? Let's start with the public key. To create the public key, we need:\n",
        "*   2 prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. They are supposed to be large (often larger than $2^{256}$). However, in the examples we will use smaller numbers for $p$ and $q$.\n",
        "*   $p$ and $q$ are used to calculate $n=p*q$.\n",
        "*   A value $\\phi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)$ is calculated, and a number $e$ that is relatively prime to $\\phi(pq)$ is chosen.\n",
        " *  For 2 numbers to be \"relatively prime\", the GCD of the 2 numbers must be 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "From these values, $n$ and $e$ are the public key and are visible to anyone. What about the private key? How do we get that? We already have all of the components needed. Using $e$ and $\\phi(pq)$, we can calculate a value $d$. This will be the private key. Before calculating $d$, let's cover a few concepts:\n",
        "*   As discussed previously, the % operator gives us the remainder of a division. This operator is known as the **modular** operator. In mathematical notation, we would write something like 12%5=2 as $5\\equiv2(mod 12)$. This means that the number 5 is equivalent to taking 2 (mod 12) (as 2%12=2). Given this knowledge, we can find something known as the **modular inverse**.\n",
        "*   If we have some value $a (mod n)$, then the modular inverse of this is $x$ where $a*x\\equiv 1 (mod n)$ https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/modular-inverses. This modular inverse will be our value $d$.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the knowledge of what we are calculating, we can now obtain $d$. The equation for this calculation is $de\\equiv1(mod\\phi(pq))$. Since $\\phi(pq)$ is not known to the public, $d$ is secure. Below is a simple algorithm that can compute a modular inverse for us. It should be noted that this works as expected due to the nature of the numbers used for the algorithm, particularly the fact that $e$ is relatively prime to $\\phi(pq)$."

        "Now that we know the key generation works, we can move on to discussing how the send an encrypted message (and how to decrypt it). For our purposes, we will assume that the message will only contain upper and lower case letters. This is a problem though. If we are using numbers to encrypt and decrypt messages, then how can we send messages with letters? The answer: ASCII encoding. All letters are already encoded as numbers in computer systems where A=65, B=66,..., Z=90,..., a=97, b=98,..., and z=122. By dealing with our letters in their ASCII encoding, we can use RSA to encrypt our messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to send a message we need to use the public key ($n$ and $e$) which has been provided to us. First, we need to know how much of the message can be sent at a time. Since $n$ can be as small as $11*13=143$, our message, which we will call $m$, must be sent one letter at a time. The reason behind this is that $m< n$ must be true. Our chosen ASCII values can be as high as 127, so a single letter will always be less than $n$ in our message. So, now that we know the limitations, let's find out how to encrypt our message.\n",
        "*   Given our message (letter) $m$, we need to raise its ASCII value to the power of $e$. We then use the modular operator with the value $n$ to get our encrypted value. Thus, we have an equation $c\\equiv m^e(mod n)$ where $c$ is our encrypted value. This is what we will send as our message.\n",
        " *  As an example, suppose we wish to send the letter 'a'. We take the ASCII code for a, which is 97. Our value for $e$ is 101, $p=11$, $q=13$, and our value for $n$ is 143. We then calculate $m^e=97^{101}\\equiv 119(mod 143)$. Thus, our encrypted letter is 119. This encrypted message could potentially be seen by anyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the ability to encrypt the message, let's now look at how to decrypt it. This requires the use of the private key ($d$). The decryption is as follows:\n",
        "*   We raise our encrypted message $c$ to the power of $d$. With this, we can then calculate $m\\equiv c(mod n)$. This $m$ is the same value that was encrypted before, so we have decrypted the message and gotten the original message!\n",
        " *  In the encryption example, we got a value $c=119$. We had values of $e=101$, $p=11$, $q=13$, and $n=143$. Using this information, we can compute $d$. Remembering that $de\\equiv1(mod\\phi(pq))$, we can find $d=101$. So, $101*101=10201\\equiv1(mod120)$. We can now use $d=101$ to decrypt our message: $c^d=119^{101}\\equiv 97(mod143)$. This is exactly the message we had encrypted, so we have obtained the original message! It should be noted that in this example $d$ and $e$ were the same value. This is, of course, not very secure. However, this is not typically the case, especially when dealing with larger values for $p$, $q$, and $e$.\n",

        "That's the RSA encryption algorithm! Well, it's a basic implementation of it. We can break this quite easily for 2 reasons. First, small numbers were used for $p$ and $q$. This means that we can easily factor $n$ and find $p$ and $q$. The combination of knowing $p$, $q$ and $e$ means that we can easily find $d$ and decrypt the message. The second reason our implementation is so easy to break is that only one letter is encrypted at a time. This also has to do with the size of $p$ and $q$, but only needing to guess one letter means its pretty easy to keep encrypting letters until you've found the encryption values for all characters. We will next look at exploiting both of these vulnerabilities to demonstrate the importance of using big $p$ and $q$ values. We can start with factoring $n$."

Finding an answer to this is difficult. It cannot be definitely stated here that they cannot be prime, but the algorithm is designed in such a way that assumes they are. The main advantage which this provides is that $n$ will only have 2 factors other than 1 and itself. If we begin to factor $n$ and realize that 24 is a factor, then we also determine that 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 are factors. This means that we have more candidates for $p$ and $q$, but knowing more factors gives us the ability to find other factors. Thus, we could potentially find the factors $p$ and $q$ more quickly. However, this is just a hypothesis. Regardless, prime numbers have been able to make encryption possible.\n",
